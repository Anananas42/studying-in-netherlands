            <p>Choosing the right university can be difficult and overwhelming. This page will hopefully help you make a better-informed decision and who knows... maybe we'll see each other in Netherlands!</p>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>No, this is not meant as a philosophical question... unfortunately. ðŸ˜„</p>
            <p>My name is Adam Pazderka and I graduated from the bilingual section of GJN in 2020.</p>
            <p>I was very excited about the possibility of studying abroad so I did some research about unis in UK and Switzerland.
                 United States sounded interesting too, but they were way too impractical.</p>
            <p>To my own surprise, I ended up studying Computer Science & Engineering at TU Delft in Netherlands where I successfully finished my first year.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm taking a gap year to avoid online education (hopefully) and work on fun projects.</p>
