            <div class="line-bottom"></div>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Start as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Nothing's lost if you start preparing only 2 weeks in advance, but starting in October or sooner can save you a lot of stress.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">The deadlines are tight, but it's all manageable. Generally you want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research potential universities</li>
                <li>Prepare all the required documents</li>
                <li>Study to get good grades or prepare for the entry exams</li>
                <li>Apply for scholarships</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pro tip:</span> When looking for a university, look for specific programmes.</p>
            <p>Unless the university is "extremely prestigious", it doesn't matter if it's ranked 10th or 50th. It's better to decide based on conrete
                programmes and research/industry possibilities.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Super Pro tip:</span> Apply for all the scholarships you can.</p>
            <p>The scholarship application process is almost identical to the university one.
                 Not only you can practice and set yourself some additional milestones in your preparation, but you can receive financial aid.</p>
            
            <h2>Applying to UK</h2>

            <p>Everything application-related goes through <a href="https://www.ucas.com/">UCAS</a> which is an application portal where you
            register and go through the whole application process.</p>
            <p>You then receive an offer, which is in most cases conditional on your resulting grades from the final exams.</p>
            <p>Some unis additionally require you to take their entry exam.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">Things you standardly need for UK:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivational letter</li>
                <li>Personal recommendation from some of your teachers</li>
                <li>Predicted grades from the final exam by some of your teachers</li>
                <li>Transcripts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Motivational letter and personal recommendation are the main reason why you need to prepare as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>It's not about how much time you spend, but about how efficiently. Writing 5 days in a row is much worse than 5 days throughout a whole month.</p>
            <p>It's important to write the motivational letter and then refine it again and again with a new perspective until it's perfect.</p>
            <p>There are many really good universities in UK, but due to Brexit and other factors, it can get very expensive.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notable universities:</span> UCL, Imperial College London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Warwick, London School of Economics</p>

            <h2>Applying to Switzerland</h2>

            <p>Definitely check out Ondrej Zikmund's post. He is currently studying physics at EPFL and even received the Bakala and Kelner scholarships.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notable universities:</span> EPFL, ETH Zurich, Geneva, Bern</p>

            <h2>Applying to Netherlands</h2>

            <p>Each university has a little bit different application process, so it's very important to choose your university and closely follow
                 instructions on their website.</p>

            <p>Watch out for deadlines and don't be afraid to write email if you haven't received some promised information.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notable universities:</span> TU Delft, Groningen, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Utrecht</p>

            <h2>Note</h2>
            <p>I highly recommend contacting students or graduates from your chosen programmes and asking them about everything.</p>
            <p>Really nice place to spend time and get to know such people (even though it isn't the primary goal) is 
                <a href="https://discover.sk/">Discover Summer Academy</a>. I really recommend it, even if you don't care about studying abroad.</p>
