            <h1 class="title">Applying to Netherlands</h1>
            <div class="line-bottom"></div>
            <p>Even though I study <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/cse/bsc-computer-science-and-engineering">Computer Science & Engineering at TU Delft</a>, there will probably be some similarities with different universities.</p>
            <p>One of the great things about Netherlands apart from it's relative location are costs which can range from
                 <span style="font-weight: bold;">670€ to 1200€ per month including tuition fees, housing and cost of living.</span></p>
            <p>It's definitely not a small amount, but it's a bargain compared to UK or US.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">Application consists of the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Register before 15 January with initial documents</li>
                <li>Provide additional documents</li>
                <li>Register for the exams</li>
                <li>Register for a specific date for each exam</li>
                <li>Complete the exams online</li>
                <li>Receive offer and decide in 2 weeks</li>
                <li>(Accepted) Immediately start looking for housing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's not that difficult to get in, but it's difficult to stay. Most people don't finish the first year. And a high proportion of people finishes in 4 years instead of 3.</p>
            
            <h2>Curriculum</h2>
            <p>Interestingly enough, school year is divided into 4 quarters where each quarter contains 3 subjects.</p>
            <p>There are homeworks, midterms and endterms. So you have exams each half-quarter and you fully focus only on 3 subjects at a time.</p>
            <p>This is great and makes your life a lot easier, since you can always remember your upcoming tasks and you don't have to put such great effort into
                time management.

            <h2>Entry exams</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">The <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/cse/bachelor-of-computer-science-and-engineering/selection-procedure">entry exams</a>
                 consist of three parts and a questionnaire to measure teamwork capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>Systematic Reasoning and Logical Thinking</li>
                <li>Algorithmic & Computational Thinking</li>
            </ul>

            
            <h2>Receiving an offer</h2>
            <p>The offer is mostly sent in April and once you receive it, you have 2 weeks to decide whether you want to accept it.</p>
            <p>This can be problematic if you also receive a conditional offer on some other university, but it's possible you won't get the required grades or results in the entry exams.</p>
            <p>I have no other advice than to think it all through carefully if this happens to you as well.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you decide to accept, IMMEDIATELY start looking for housing. Housing is a big problem in Netherlands, but manageable if you start soon enough.</p>
